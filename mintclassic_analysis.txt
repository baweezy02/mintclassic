This article talks about the problem and recommendation, conclusion to the mintclassic database. The definition of the problem is how can Mint classic Company 
can close one of their storage facility and reduce inventory while still maintaining timely service to customer.
They want suggestion and recommendation on reorganizing and reducing inventory.


The second step is familarizing with the database
Familiarize yourself with the database structure to see what kind of data are stored in the database. Since the database is all about the business. Familiarity 
with the database with lets you familiarize with the business process. Study the EER(Extended Entity relationship) to see how the tables are related/connected.
EER is like a blueprint to the database. Using the EER you can understand how data flows. How data process and business activity occur. For example an employee
works with a customer to make an order. An order can have many products. Each product belong to a productline and are stored in a warehouse.


The third step is to investigate the business problem
Review the problem. Mint Classic Company is looking to close one of its storage facility. They need recommendation and suggestion in reducing or reorganizing 
inventory while still maintaining timely customer service.

You can start to isolate the data that affects the problem you are trying to address. Which field store data related to the business problem. 
Which table are they housed. Look at those tables carefully. Use sql to query those data.

select w.warehouseCode, w.warehouseName,  w.warehousePctCap, p.quantityInStock from 
products p, warehouses w where p.warehouseCode = w.warehouseCode;


The average of the quantityInStock = 5046.645           i.e μ = (∑X)/N)
Median of the quantityInStock = 5437.                   (i.e {(n+1)/2} )
Variance of the quantityInStock = 8560732.              (i.e σ² = (∑X-μ)²/N )
Standard deviation of the quantityInStock = 2925.873    (i.e σ = √(∑X-μ)²/N )

This query displays from two tables warehouses and products to show the warehouses and the total inventory in each warehouse location.


CREATE 
    ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED 
    DEFINER = `root`@`localhost` 
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
VIEW `product_reduction` AS
    SELECT 
        `products`.`productCode` AS `productCode`,
        `products`.`productName` AS `productName`,
        `products`.`productLine` AS `productLine`,
        `products`.`warehouseCode` AS `WarehouseCode`,
        `products`.`quantityInStock` AS `quantityInstock`,
        (`products`.`quantityInStock` - ((5 / 100) * `products`.`quantityInStock`)) AS `reduction_by_5%`
    FROM
        `products`;
		
		This code isolate the data we are concerned about and create a view called product_reduction.


The Fouth step is to Formulate suggestion and recommendation for the business problem
Using sql to analyze data. Are there products that are likely to be ordered. Does the price affect the sale of products. Conduct an What-if-analysis. 
What impact will it have on the company if a reduction of quantity in hand by 5% for each item is made. Use your findings and conclusions to suggest 
recommendation that the client will use to address business questions.

After I run the creation of the product_reduction table to produce a view of the table by 5 percent. These are the data and statistcs;

select productName, productLine, quantityInstock, quantityInStock - 5/100*quantityInstock as "reduction_by_5%"
from product_reduction;


Classic car = 38
Motorcycle and plane = 25
Vintage cars = 24
Train, ship, Truck and Buses = 23

The average of quantityInStock = 4794.313182  i.e X = (∑X)/N) 
Median of quantityInStock = 5165.625           (i.e {(n+1)/2} )
Variance = 7726060.705                          (i.e σ² = (∑X-X)²/N )
Standard Deviation = 2792.300485                 (i.e σ = √(∑X-X)²/N )

select w.warehouseCode, w.warehouseName,  w.warehousePctCap, round(sum(p.quantityInStock) - 5/100*
sum(p.quantityInStock)) total_in_stock from product_reduction p, warehouses w where 
p.warehouseCode = w.warehouseCode group by w.warehouseCode;


This code displays the warehouse quantityInStock if each item is reduced by 5 percent.
 

select p.productCode, p.productLine, p.productName, sum(od.quantityOrdered) as total_car_order from 
product_reduction p join orderDetails od on p.productCode = od.productCode join orders o on o.orderNumber = 
od.orderNumber where od.orderNumber in (select o.orderNumber from orders o where o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber)
group by productName, productCode order by 4 desc limit 10;

This query displays the top 10 most ordered product. The Classic Cars 1992 Ferrari 360 Spider red and 1937 Lincoln Berline are the 2 most ordered cars with 
1808 and 1111 orders respectively.

select p.productCode, p.productLine, p.productName, sum(od.quantityOrdered) as total_car_order from 
product_reduction p join orderDetails od on p.productCode = od.productCode join orders o on o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
where od.orderNumber in (select o.orderNumber from orders o where o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber)
group by productName, productCode order by 4 asc limit 10;

This query displays the 10 least ordered product. The vintage cars 1957 Ford Thunderbird and 1970 Chevy Chevelle SS 454 are the two least
ordered cars with 767 and 803 orders respectively.


select p.productCode, p.productLine, p.productName, sum(od.quantityOrdered) as total_car_order from 
product_reduction p join orderDetails od on p.productCode = od.productCode join orders o on o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
where od.orderNumber in (select o.orderNumber from orders o where o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber)
group by productName, productCode order by 4 asc limit 10;

This query displays the total orders of products by productLine and added the warehouse capacity column from the warehouse table.

The average of the total_car_order  = 968.0366972 (i.e μ = (∑X)/N) 
The median of the total_car_order = 963 (i.e {(n+1)/2} 
The mode of the total_car_order = 972
The variance of the total_car_order = 10354.53076 (i.e σ² = (∑X-μ)²/N )
The standard deviation of the total_car_order = 101.7572148 (i.e σ = √(∑X-μ)²/N )
 

The Fifth step is Describing your recommendations and conclusions, supporting them with sql script.

Two things are key to my conclusions. Firstly, warehousecode A stores productLine like motorcycle, planes, and warehousecode B stores classic cars, 
warehousecode C stores vintage cars while warehousecode D stores trucks & buses, trains and ships. All having a warehouse percentage capacity of 72, 67, 50, 75 
respectively. Ideally warehouse capacity utilization might seem like it should be 100%. However, the ideal number is actually closer to 80%. 


Secondly, The total quantity in stock for warehousecode a, b, c, d are 125104, 208224, 118636, 75411 respectively. The total quantity ordered for warehousecode
a, b, c, d are 24650, 35582, 22933, 22351 respectively.

select p.warehouseCode, w.warehouseName, sum(o.quantityOrdered) total_order from product_reduction p join 
orderdetails o on p.productCode = o.productCode join warehouses w on p.warehouseCode = w.warehouseCode 
group by warehouseName, warehouseCode;

This query display the sum of the quantity ordered by warehouseName and warehouseCode.

The average of the total_order = 26379.00 (i.e i.e μ = (∑X)/N)
The median of the total_order = 23791.50 (i.e {(n+1)/2} )
The variance of the total_order = 28946087.50 (i.e σ² = (∑X-μ)²/N )
The standard deviation of the total_order = 5380.16 (i.e σ = √(∑X-μ)²/N )

 


This analysis covers descriptive and inferential statistics. The descriptive statistics gives the central tendency of the data, while the inferential statistics
 uses that central tendency to make inferences.
 
The limitation of the analysis are listed as follows;
1. Two statistcs analysis are used
2. The sample data collected does not accurately represent the entire population
3. The hypothesis test is not carried out more times to produce an accurate confidence interval.



														z = X-μ/σ/√n
														where X is the sample mean 
														μ is the population mean
														σ is the standard deviation
														n is the sample size
														
														t = 4794.313182 - 5046.645 /2792.300485 / √109
														t = 4775.444
														

As 4775.444 > 1.64
Thus it is concluded that the production reduction by 5% helped in reducing warehouse inventory and maintaining timely service to customers.
